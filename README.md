For addtional interworking
Refer to https://github.com/confluentinc

Build and Install
=================

This extension is supported on [those platforms](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/supported-platforms.html) that PostgreSQL is. The installation steps depend on your operating system.

You can also keep up with the latest fixes and features cloning the Git repository.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/kayform/bwcontrol.git
$ PATH=/path/to/bin/pg_config:$PATH
$ USE_PGXS=1 make
$ USE_PGXS=1 make install
```

Configuration
=============

You need to add some  parameters at postgresql.auto.conf:

```
bw.bwpath = '/path/to/bin/bottledwater'
bw.kafka_broker = 'KAFKA:9092'
bw.schema_registry='KAFKA:8081'
bw.consumer='KAFKA:8083/connectors'
```

After changing these parameters, a restart or reload using 'pg_reload_conf()' is needed.

Examples
========

calling functions via SQL.

1. Create connection with Kafka-connect to synchronize whithlisting of table.
	testdb=# pg_make_kafka_connect("testconnection");
	INFO:  Success(0)
2. Make whitelisting of table.
	testdb=# pg_add_ingest_table("myschema", "testtable", 1, 1, '');
	INFO:  Success(0)
3. Remove table from whitelist to except sync with Kafka-connect.
	testdb=# pg_del_ingest_table("myschema", "testtable");
	INFO:  Success(0)
4. Check status (bwttledwater, replication_slot, kafka connect, whitelist).
	testdb=# select pg_get_status_ingest();
	INFO:  process running(0)
5. Drop connection with Kafka-connect. It will stop to synchronize data stream with Kafka.
	testdb=# pg_delete_kafka_connect("testconnection");
	INFO:  Success(0)

Bottledwater
--------------

Besides the configuration above, it is necessary to configure a replication connection to use bottledwater

First, add an entry at pg_hba.conf:

```
local    replication     myuser                     trust
host     replication     myuser     10.1.2.3/32     trust
```

Also, set max_wal_senders at postgresql.conf:

```
max_wal_senders = 1
```

A restart is necessary if you changed max_wal_senders.

You are ready to try bwcontrol. In one terminal:

```
```

In another terminal: kafka consol consumer

```
```

The output in the terminal is: kafka consol consumer

```
```

Dropping ...

```
```
